# AP CSA Classes Code Along
Using this repository, we'll learn about how classes work in Object-Oriented Programming and Java by building a class that allows us to track the fuel usage for the dashboard of a vehicle focussing just on fuel and the range it can drive. We will start out by writing parts of the class and then testing it using a driver class. As we write the program together, write comments to help you remember what is what.
